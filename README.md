## Open in colab [WIP]
* Compute embeddings with ProtT5 (up to 4.5k residues due to colab limmitations)
* Code for cleaning up / preproc of DrugBank (in development stage - needs cleanup)
* Sampler for drug/target neighborhoods
* Write an efficient sampler/negative sampler for graph tuples [TODO]
* Train [TODO]
* Validate [TODO]
